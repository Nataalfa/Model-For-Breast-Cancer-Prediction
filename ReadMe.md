# Model Selection
In exploring models for this prediction. I'm using helpful exploratory tool that called **Lazypredict**. This tool helps with baseline and sanity check.

Basicly this tool helped you Run 30 Machine learning algorithms with 1 line of code :rocket:. it automates all the fit and predict process.

Let's try this library :point_down: 
- first install lazypredict `!pip install lazypredict`

- Next step just see this Screenshoot below!!:point_down:

### CAUTION 
- **It's NOT meant for product choice. It is meant for exploration of all models**

## This is also my first time trying this tool, either this tool has so many controversion, i think this tool is very helpful if used in a right way  

For further details about what model i choose, and what process i do on creating this model for <b>Breast Cancer prediction</b> you can check out my colab<b>[notebook](https://github.com/Nataalfa/Model-For-Breast-Cancer-Prediction/blob/main/Breast_cancer_prediction_model.ipynb)</b>. On that notebook i elaborate each steps i used, including what **scoring method to used for this model, and the reason**.
Thank you :grimacing:
