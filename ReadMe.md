# Model Selection
In exploring models for this prediction. I'm using helpful exploratory tool that called **Lazypredict**. This tool helps with baseline and sanity check.

Basicly this tool helped you Run 30 Machine learning algorithms with 1 line of code :rocket:. it automates all the fit and predict process.

Let's try this library :point_down: 
- first step, install lazypredict `!pip install lazypredict`

- Next step, just see this Screenshoot below!!:point_down:

### CAUTION 
- **It's NOT meant for product choice. It is meant for exploration of all models**

## This is also my first time trying this tool. Despite the controversies surrounding it, I believe this tool can be very helpful if used in the right way.  

If you're curious about the model I picked and the steps I took to make a <b>Breast cancer prediction model</b>, check out my <b>[Colab notebook]((https://github.com/Nataalfa/Model-For-Breast-Cancer-Prediction/blob/main/Breast_cancer_prediction_model.ipynb))</b>. I go into detail on everything I did, like **what scoring method I used and why**. Thanks!:grimacing:
